Game Wishlist is a tool to manage games that a user is looking to purchase in the future.

The homepage requires that a user either sign up or log in to get started. The login credentials must be unique and all relevant fields must be filled-in in order to set up an account.

After getting logged in, the user can see a list of games that they have added to their list. They have the option to add a new game, or edit an existing one.

If they choose edit, they can either change the name of the title or delete it. If they choose edit, they must enter a valid string to save the update.

The application does not allow for users to view games that others have added to their list.

Happy Gaming!
